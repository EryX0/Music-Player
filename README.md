I hope you enjoy it.

## Details
It was just fun training in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love Music and I decided to make it.
 
## UPDATE 1
On May 4, 2023, Vanilla JavaScript replaced by TypeScript

It's Available on TypeScript Branch. Check it Please :)

The last version is still available on the main branch.

## UPDATE 2
On May 16, 2023, The new implementation was released.

In this implementation, I used "OOP" to have a modular program.

I also used "Webpack" to bundle the codes. I installed and configured it myself.

In the end, I used "Axios" for fetching data instead of "fetch" and "SASS" instead of "CSS".

The last versions are still available on other branches.
